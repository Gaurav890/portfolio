## 📝 About Section

Hey! I'm Gaurav — a Product Manager who bridges the gap between 'what should we build?' and 'how the hell do we build it?'

Over the past 3 years, I've shipped AI-powered virtual try-on experiences, scaled enterprise CMS platforms, and coordinated ML training pipelines (yes, I know what RLHF means). I'm the PM who can jump into a technical design doc with engineers in the morning, run user interviews at lunch, and present a data-driven product roadmap to stakeholders by EOD.

Currently finishing my CS Master's at San Francisco Bay University (graduating Dec 2025). My team recently won **'Best Use of Claude'** at Cal Hacks 12.0 for building ELDA.ai — an AI eldercare assistant. When I'm not building products, you'll find me debugging Apache Spark assignments, mentoring students, or exploring Oakland's coffee scene.

**What I bring:** Product strategy, technical fluency, and the ability to make cross-functional teams actually enjoy working together. I thrive in 0→1 environments where ambiguity is high and impact potential is even higher.

**What I'm looking for:** PM or Technical PM roles at startups solving real problems with AI/ML. Bonus points if you're working on consumer tech, healthcare, or anything that makes people's lives genuinely better.

Let's build something great together. 🚀
